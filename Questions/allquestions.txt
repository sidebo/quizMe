Q: Explain how secondary tracks are estimated in the ATLAS minbias analyses.
A: The number of secondaries are estimated from the d0 distributions. The central part of this distribution is dominated by primary tracks, the tails are dominated by secondaries. Secondaries are tracks from hadronic interactions (dominant), photon conversions and decays of long-lived particles (strange mesons, lambdas and kaons). In slices of pT, templates are used to fit the different contributions in the sideband regions, e.g. |d0|>5 mm or so. The reason for doing it in slices in pT is that contributions are different as a function of pT (e.g. more photon conversions at low-pT). The normalisation of the different sources are allowed to float, and the fit result may then be used to predict the value in the central region. I think the uncertainty is estimated by varying the sideband region definition, possibly also by calculating the values with distorted material samples.

Q: What is the GZK cutoff?
A: The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit, postulating that cosmic rays should have energies below 5e19 eV (about 8 joules). The reason being that such protons should interact with CMB photons and produce pions via the delta resonance, i.e. gamma_CMB + proton -> Delta^+ -> p + pi^0. However, cosmic rays with energies above this limit have been observed. Not many though. One was measured to have energy 3.12e20 which is the same kinetic energy as carried by a baseball at 60 mph (100 km/h) [QUESTION: what about other particles than protons — are there corresponding cut-offs for photons, electrons?]

Q: Explain how in python objects are passed to functions. By reference or by value? 
A: Technically, things are passed by value, however, names in python are always bound to object references. So in practise, references to objects are passed. Now, it’s important to distinguish between mutable and immutable types. For example, int and float objects are immutable. x=4 means “name x is bound to integer object with value 4”. This object can never change (immutable), but when assigning x =5 x is rebound to a new integer object. Everything (almost) in python is an object. So when passing x to a function def func(x) in which first line is x=5, a new local variable is created (and bound to integer object with value 5). In caller’s scope x is unaffected. A list is a mutable object. It can be modified inside a function, like def additemtolist(foo): foo.append(1), which when called changes the caller’s list. However, if inside the function it would instead say foo = [1, 2, 3] the caller’s list is unaffected: foo becomes a local variable. I think this is because assignment always means rebinding. I don’t fully understand this part though.

Q: What does ‘OLV’ mean, and what is it used for?

C: physics,ATLAS,HWW

Q: What does ‘CJV’ mean, and what is it used for?
A: Central-Jet-Veto, used to veto events with jets with pT>20GeV inside the VBF-tagged jets’ rapidity gap. It is used to increase signal significance since in VBF events there’s no colour flow between the interacting quarks, so one typically expects no jets between the two VBF-tagged jets.

A: The proton, neutron etc. have a mass of ~1 GeV, which is the natural (empirical) scale of QCD. The pions however weigh some 100 MeV. Light quarks are very light, which should mean most of mass are glue. But then why is the pion so much lighter?

A: QED has three normalisation constants which can be absorbed into the charge and mass of the electron. The nr of normalisation constants in IVB theory grows with the nr of vertices in the diagram, and is non-renormalizable (renormalizibility is restored by formulating the theory as a gauge theory, which implies the existence of the Z0 boson)

Q: Who received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1958, and for what? Hint: blue light
A: Igor Tamm, Ilya Frank and Pavel Cherenkov (all Soviet), “for the discovery and the interpretation of the Cherenkov effect”. Cherenkov first observed it in 1934 when gamma rays went through a water flask. It was theoretically developed by Frank and Tamm three years later. The Cherenkov effect is similar to the sonic boom or a boat in water: if the particle moves faster than the speed of light in the medium, it produces a shock front of light, just like a plane in air produces a sound wave front or a boat through water a wave front.
C: physics,NPP,particles

Q: Explain how the LUCID detector works and what is its purpose.
A: Cherenkov detector with aluminium tubes filled with C4F10 gas. Sitting 17 m from IP at 5.6 < |eta| < 6.0. Charged particles generates Cherenkov light, and more light is created for particles from the IP because they have a longer travel path through the tube (the signal is required to be above a threshold, this will suppress smaller signals from background). The detector measures luminosity, online, bunch-by-bunch. Uses different event-based counting algorithms.

Q: Why are there no Flavour-Changing-Neutral-Currents (like b->s via Z exchange) in the SM?

Q: What is diamagnetism? Give examples of materials that are diamagnetic.
A: A material which is repulsive upon applying an external magnetic field. This is in contrast to para- or ferromagnets. One consequence of this property is that diamagnets can be made to levitate.

Q: What type of measurement at the LHC can constraint parton shower parameters (and are thus used to construct tunes)?
A: One example is pT(Z) in DY(Z)->ll measurements. ISR determines the low-pT regime and is thus sensitive to PS parameters. See https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP09%282014%29145.pdf
C: HWW,ATLAS,LHC

Q: Explain the concept of renormalisation within QFT.
A: Briefly: diagrams with loops introduce divergences (momentum integrated to infty). These divergences can be absorbed into the definition of charge,mass,or whatever quantity considered -> renormalised charge,mass… depending on Q^2 —> running of coupling constants. Alternatively: divergences appear because we use the wrong “bare” charge when we should use renormalised (Q^2 dependent). Choice of scale is arbitrary; if full series is computed the same result is obtained regardless. For finite series, we have to chose. I think something like mu^2 ~ 100^2 GeV^2 is typically used, but it is also set dynamically per event (see e.g. https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/FAQ-General-13)
C: physics,particles,qft,HWW,fields

Q: Explain the concept of a pomeron, and how it appeared historically. Bonus points for the odderon.
A: Pomeron=a special Reggeon trajectory. A trajectory is a straight line in M^2 vs J (ang mom) plot, on which hadrons were observed to line up. To explain a rising trend in XS vs s one introduced hypothetical pomeron as such a trajectory, CP-even with quantum numbers of the vacuum. Since it doesn’t carry colour (or any other charge), two protons exchanging a pomeron does not produce a bunch of pions in between, rather protons may or may not be broken up and found in forward regions. Pomeron dominates diffractive XS which is something like 30% at LHC. At HERA one could measure the pomeron content in quark-gluon picture and found it’s gluon dominated (it can actually be modelled well as gluon-gluon state. Odderon is the CP-odd counterpart (don’t know why it’s expected to exist, symmetry reasons?), not yet found.

Q: Describe track momentum resolution for the ATLAS ID (bonus point for commenting on the relation to the muon system)
A: See formula in Giulias lic http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1171870/FULLTEXT01.pdf. The resolution divided by pT has two terms, one pT dependent and one constant. The former is =0.05%*pT[GeV], comes from intrinsic resolution of measurement points, the latter=1% comes from multiple scattering. The former degrades with pT since high-pT<->straight track<->poorer curvature measurement. At pT=20 GeV the two contributions are equal. For muons, which pass the MS in which the magnetic field is lower but the layers further apart. For very high-pT muons the MS provides the best resolution, for low-pT (HWW analysis) the ID does.
C: physics,ATLAS,HWW,tracking

Q: Explain the WIMP miracle.
A: My rough take on it: To get the “correct” relic abundance of DM in the early universe, when DM “froze out” from ordinary matter, we can estimate the self-annihilation XS of DM. Correct value = measured value ~0.1, implying the XS equals something typical of the weak interaction.

Q: Who got the NPP 2008?
A: Kobayashi, Maskawa (1/4) each and Nambu, the former for predicting third generation of quarks (needed to explain observed CP violation in weak interactions) and the latter for work on spont. symm breaking 
C: physics,particles,NPP

Q: What’s the cosmological constant problem?
A: The fact that if you calculate the energy from quantum fluctuations you get a value which is vastly larger than what we observe based on the expansion of the universe. Expected based on planck scale yields energy 120 orders of magnitude larger than observed. An incredible fine tuning from contributions from physics not yet known would be needed. No symmetry is known which could explain the cancellation. (If I understand well, boson fields contribute positively, fermion fields negatively —> more fermions than bosons —> negative energy —> expansion (rather than contraction))

Q: Name a way to obtain the Planck scale (mass) and length.
A: One way is to consider the gravitational energy at which particle-antiparticle pairs would appear spontaneously, i.e. where classical gravity would break down. This yields about the planck mass (~10^19 GeV) and the planck length (10^-35 m). A different “characterisation” is to consider a black hole with mass M_Planck, for which the Schwarzild radius would be equal to its Compton wavelength.

Q: What’s the difference between Neyman’s chi-square and Pearson’s chi-square?
A: Neyman uses measured values to estimate errors, Pearson uses expected values
C: statistics

Q: What’s the “bottom-up” and “top-down” approaches, specifically in terms of computer science?
A: Bottom-up emphasises coding and early testing (“stimulus/data driven” in signal processing/psychology). Top-down means thinking through before and designing core parts before implementation (“theory driven” in signal processing/psychology)
