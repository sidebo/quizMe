Q: Explain how secondary tracks are estimated in the ATLAS minbias analyses.
A: The number of secondaries are estimated from the d0 distributions. The central part of this distribution is dominated by primary tracks, the tails are dominated by secondaries. Secondaries are tracks from hadronic interactions (dominant), photon conversions and decays of long-lived particles (strange mesons, lambdas and kaons). In slices of pT, templates are used to fit the different contributions in the sideband regions, e.g. |d0|>5 mm or so. The reason for doing it in slices in pT is that contributions are different as a function of pT (e.g. more photon conversions at low-pT). The normalisation of the different sources are allowed to float, and the fit result may then be used to predict the value in the central region. I think the uncertainty is estimated by varying the sideband region definition, possibly also by calculating the values with distorted material samples.

Q: What is the GZK cutoff?
A: The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit, postulating that cosmic rays should have energies below 5e19 eV (about 8 joules). The reason being that such protons should interact with CMB photons and produce pions via the delta resonance, i.e. gamma_CMB + proton -> Delta^+ -> p + pi^0. However, cosmic rays with energies above this limit have been observed. Not many though. One was measured to have energy 3.12e20 which is the same kinetic energy as carried by a baseball at 60 mph (100 km/h) [QUESTION: what about other particles than protons — are there corresponding cut-offs for photons, electrons?]

Q: Explain how in python objects are passed to functions. By reference or by value? 
A: Technically, things are passed by value, however, names in python are always bound to object references. So in practise, references to objects are passed. Now, it’s important to distinguish between mutable and immutable types. For example, int and float objects are immutable. x=4 means “name x is bound to integer object with value 4”. This object can never change (immutable), but when assigning x =5 x is rebound to a new integer object. Everything (almost) in python is an object. So when passing x to a function def func(x) in which first line is x=5, a new local variable is created (and bound to integer object with value 5). In caller’s scope x is unaffected. A list is a mutable object. It can be modified inside a function, like def additemtolist(foo): foo.append(1), which when called changes the caller’s list. However, if inside the function it would instead say foo = [1, 2, 3] the caller’s list is unaffected: foo becomes a local variable. I think this is because assignment always means rebinding. I don’t fully understand this part though.

Q: What does ‘OLV’ mean, and what is it used for?
A: Outside-Lepton-Veto, used to veto events with leptons outside the VBF-tagged-jets rapidity gap. This increases the significance to select signal events, I presume, since leptons outside this gap isn’t expected for signal.
C: physics,ATLAS,HWW

Q: What does ‘CJV’ mean, and what is it used for?
A: Central-Jet-Veto, used to veto events with jets with pT>20GeV inside the VBF-tagged jets’ rapidity gap. It is used to increase signal significance since in VBF events there’s no colour flow between the interacting quarks, so one typically expects no jets between the two VBF-tagged jets.

Q: What is CEPC, and what is its goal?

It could after having completed a Higgs precision measurement phase be upgraded to a 50-70 TeV proton-proton machine (Super Proton Proton Collider, SPPS). According to its own website, the cost/luminosity ratio would be low. Yang (perhaps most famous chinese physicist, part founder of Yang-Mills theory) has expressed concerns about the project.

Q: What is meant by the statement that the pion is too light?
A: The proton, neutron etc. have a mass of ~1 GeV, which is the natural (empirical) scale of QCD. The pions however weigh some 100 MeV. Light quarks are very light, which should mean most of mass are glue. But then why is the pion so much lighter?

A: QED has three normalisation constants which can be absorbed into the charge and mass of the electron. The nr of normalisation constants in IVB theory grows with the nr of vertices in the diagram, and is non-renormalizable (renormalizibility is restored by formulating the theory as a gauge theory, which implies the existence of the Z0 boson)

Q: Who received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1958, and for what? Hint: blue light
A: Igor Tamm, Ilya Frank and Pavel Cherenkov (all Soviet), “for the discovery and the interpretation of the Cherenkov effect”. Cherenkov first observed it in 1934 when gamma rays went through a water flask. It was theoretically developed by Frank and Tamm three years later. The Cherenkov effect is similar to the sonic boom or a boat in water: if the particle moves faster than the speed of light in the medium, it produces a shock front of light, just like a plane in air produces a sound wave front or a boat through water a wave front.
C: physics,NPP,particles

Q: Explain how the LUCID detector works and what is its purpose.
A: Cherenkov detector with aluminium tubes filled with C4F10 gas. Sitting 17 m from IP at 5.6 < |eta| < 6.0. Measures luminosity, online, bunch-by-bunch. When a signal above threshold is registered a hit is registered. Typically uses some event-based counting, I believe.

Q: Why are there no Flavour-Changing-Neutral-Currents (like b->s via Z exchange) in the SM?
